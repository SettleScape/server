About

Description
================================================================================
This repository contains the configuration for the SettleScape Minecraft server.

Copyright
================================================================================
(See ``/Copyright.txt`` for more info)

The Copyrights of the files in this repo vary, since this repo is a collection of config files, all of which start out being automatically created by the plugins this server is using.  As there is literally no way around this, there is no way for us to standardize a single copyright across the entire repo.

While this does unfortunately preclude SettleScape copyrighting most of the config files, there are still a few files in this repo that we do own the copyright for;  these are listed in ``/Copyright.txt``, and are subject to the following licenses:

+ Code is licensed under the GNU Lesser Affero General Public License 3.0 (LAGPL 3).
+ Non-code is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4) license
