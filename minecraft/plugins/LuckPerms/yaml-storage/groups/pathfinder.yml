# Superpowers
- essentials.ext    # Puts you out if you're on fire.  Nice.
- essentials.feed   # Fills your hunger bar.  No idea what it does to satiation.
- essentials.heal   # Also removes potion effects.  Hopefully only negative?  Haven't tested.
# - essentials.repair # Can be used to repair one held item.
- essentials.rest   # Counts as having slept, and therefore resets the phantom counter.
