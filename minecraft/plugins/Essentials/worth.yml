# Determines how much items are worth on the server.
# This can be set in this file, or by running the /setworth command.
worth:

  # Items not listed in this file will not be sellable on the server
  # Setting the worth to 0 will sell items for free, delete the item or set to -1 to disable.

  # This will set the worth of all logs to '2'
  # log: 2.0

  # This will work similar to the above syntax
  # wool:
  #   '0': 20

  # This will only allow selling leaves with datavalue '0' and '1'
  # leaves:
  #   '0': 1.0
  #   '1': 1.0

  # This will allow the selling of all, but sells '0' slightly cheaper
  # sapling:
  #   '0': 2.0
  #   '*': 2.5
