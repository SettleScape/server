# This file contains custom permission sets which will be assigned to your players
# depending on their current status.
#
# This is all managed by towny and pushed directly to CraftBukkits SuperPerms.
# These will be in addition to any you manually assign in your specific permission plugin.
#
# You may assign any Permission nodes here, including those from other plugins.
# You may also create any custom ranks you require.
# You may change the names of any of the ranks except: nomad, default, mayor, king, ranks.
#
# If you want to, you can negate permissions nodes from nodes by doing the following:
# Ex:
#    - towny.command.plot.*
#    - -towny.command.plot.set.jail
# In this example the user is given full rights to all of the /plot command nodes,
# but has had their ability to set a plot to a Jail plot type.

# The 'nomad' permissions are given to all players in all Towny worlds, townless and players who are part of a town.
