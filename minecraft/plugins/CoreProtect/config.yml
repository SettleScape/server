#CoreProtect Config

# If enabled, extra data is displayed when doing rollbacks and restores.
# If disabled, you can manually trigger it in-game by adding "#verbose"
# to the end of your rollback statement.
verbose: false

# MySQL is optional and not required.
# If you prefer to use MySQL, enable the following and fill out the fields.
use-mysql: false
table-prefix: co_
mysql-host: 127.0.0.1
mysql-port: 3306
mysql-database: database

# If enabled, CoreProtect will check for updates when your server starts up.
# If an update is available, you'll be notified via your server console.
check-updates: true

# If enabled, other plugins will be able to utilize the CoreProtect API.
api-enabled: true

# If no radius is specified in a rollback or restore, this value will be
# used as the radius. Set to "0" to disable automatically adding a radius.
default-radius: 5 ## Distance at which you can open a chest in Vanilla Minecraft (inclusive), so a good default.  While it may seem like a bad idea to have a default for rollbacks and restores, it's basically essentially for lookups.

# The maximum radius that can be used in a command. Set to "0" to disable.
# To run a rollback or restore without a radius, you can use "r:#global".
max-radius: 64

# If enabled, items taken from containers (etc) will be included in rollbacks.
rollback-items: true

# If enabled, entities, such as killed animals, will be included in rollbacks.
rollback-entities: false

# If enabled, generic data, like zombies burning in daylight, won't be logged.
skip-generic-data: true

# Logs blocks placed by players.
block-place: true

# Logs blocks broken by players.
block-break: true

# Logs blocks that break off of other blocks; for example, a sign or torch
# falling off of a dirt block that a player breaks. This is required for
# beds/doors to properly rollback.
natural-break: true

# Properly track block movement, such as sand or gravel falling.
block-movement: false ## Not worth tracking, because they only move in the y axis, and Towny protects 100% of the y-axis.

# Properly track blocks moved by pistons.
pistons: false ## Not particularly useful, since Towny protects against this.  This is a lot to track, with not much benefit.

# Logs blocks that burn up in a fire.
block-burn: true ## Shouldn't be possible, since this is disabled in Essentials.

# Logs when a block naturally ignites, such as from fire spreading.
block-ignite: false ## Technically, we don't care if a block's been ignited -- only if it's been burned.  We might need to know ignition in order to know who started the fire, but burning has been disabled in Essentials, so even that doesn't matter.

# Logs explosions, such as TNT and Creepers.
explosions: true

# Track when an entity changes a block, such as an Enderman destroying blocks.
entity-change: false ## Will end-up logging every time a sheep munches on grass.  Better to handle this in other ways, such as by making it so Endermen can't pick up blocks in the first place, which we do in Towny.

# Logs killed entities, such as killed cows and enderman.
entity-kills: false ## Entities are protected by Towny.  Entities outside of Towny are fair-game.  Even if protected entities are killed, it's better to spawn-egg them back in, rather than use this coreprotect setting, since it will have almost entirely false positives.

# Logs text on signs. If disabled, signs will be blank when rolled back.
sign-text: true

# Logs lava and water sources placed/removed by players who are using buckets.
buckets: true

# Logs natural tree leaf decay.
leaf-decay: false ## Leaves aren't important-enough to justify logging

# Logs tree growth. Trees are linked to the player who planted the sappling.
tree-growth: false ## Not necessary, since we can just inspect the tree's trunk.

# Logs mushroom growth.
mushroom-growth: true

# Logs natural vine growth.
vine-growth: false ## This is a lot to log...

# Logs when portals such as Nether portals generate naturally.
portals: false ## Why would we care about this?

# Logs water flow. If water destroys other blocks, such as torches,
# this allows it to be properly rolled back.
water-flow: true ## Important for rolling back griefed redstone contraptions.

# Logs lava flow. If lava destroys other blocks, such as torches,
# this allows it to be properly rolled back.
lava-flow: true

# Allows liquid to be properly tracked and linked to players.
# For example, if a player places water which flows and destroys torches,
# it can all be properly restored by rolling back that single player.
liquid-tracking: true ## Important for tracking liquid griefs, such as are done against redstone 

# Track item transactions, such as when a player takes items from a
# chest, furnace, or dispenser. Necessary for any item based rollbacks.
item-transactions: false ## Mostly unnecessary, since players can put anything they care about into a chest only they can access.

# Track player interactions, such as when a player opens a door, presses
# a button, or opens a chest. Player interactions can't be rolled back.
player-interactions: true ## *Rarely* useful, but is essential for avoiding drama when friends turn on friends.

# Logs messages that players send in the chat.
player-messages: true

# Logs all commands used by players.
player-commands: false ## Handled by commandlog

# Logs the logins and logouts of players.
player-sessions: true

# Logs when a player changes their Minecraft username.
username-changes: true

# Logs changes made via the plugin "WorldEdit" if it's in use on your server.
worldedit: false ## Restricted only to administrators, which have ultimate trust anyway.

# Logs items dropped by players.
item-drops: true

# Logs items picked up by players.
item-pickups: true

# Track all hopper transactions, such as when a hopper removes items from a
# chest, furnace, or dispenser.
