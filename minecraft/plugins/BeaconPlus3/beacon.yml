Range Calculator:
  # REMAINING_POWER : Use remaining power as range
  # TOTAL_POWER : Use total power as range
  Power Source: REMAINING_POWER
  # CLASSIFIED / PERCENTILE / EXPONENTIAL
  Mode: PERCENTILE ## Classified would be best if it were interpolated;  alas, it is not, which makes it effectively broken given that the left side is power and not blocks.  The power forumla sucks because it can't have a slope.  That leaves the linear formula, which does pretty well on the whole.
  Classified: ## Left side is sum of squares of odd numbers `n` and lower;  right side is `2^(n+2)`.  (In other words:  For every layer you add to the beacon, you get twice as much range.)  Formula that yields values very close to the below:  y=2^((9x+(1944x^2-64)^0.5)/24)^0.333+((9x-(1944x^2-64)^0.5)/24)^0.333+2
