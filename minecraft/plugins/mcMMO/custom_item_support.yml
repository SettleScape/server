# This is meant to be a general config for allowing mcMMO to allow interaction with custom items.
# In the future, I would like to add configs to be specific about certain custom items.
# For now, support is generalized to whether the custom item has a custom model.
# This is an easy solution to implement for now, but not the most ideal.
