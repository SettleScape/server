# the amount of ticks to wait between each radar bar update
# at least 1, values below will be clamped
# TIP: the lower the period, the smoother the radar bar will feel to players
# TIP: if you are experiencing performance issues, increasing the period can reduce lag
# default = 1
period: 1 ## At 20TPS, `1` is about 20fps.
#period: 2 ## Feels only slightly laggy.  I wouldn't really recommend going higher than this.
#period: 5 ## At 20TPS, `5` is 250ms, which is about the human reaction time.

# automatically save all radar dots and world setting whenever the world saves
# this can prevent data loss in the event of a server crash or a power outage
# pick either: true | false
# default = true
autosave: false ## Happens way too frequently for a feature very few people use.

# radar options
radar:

  # the field of view
  # between 0 and 360, values outside this range will be clamped
  # default = 90
  #fov: 90 ## Make sense
  fov: 93 ## Allows two cardinal directions to display at once, effectively allowing for diagonals, like NE.  `93` is the value that does this perfectly, at least with a size 29 bar.

  # the amount of characters that the radar content will take up
  # at least 0, values below will be clamped
  # TIP: use an uneven number so that radar dots can be positioned directly in the center of the bar
  # default = 31
  size: 29 ## This is the same size as the bossbar.
  #size: 15 ## I like this to be a multiple of the FoV.

# boss bar options
bossbar: ## I wish I could disable this...

  # the color of the boss bar
  # pick one from: BLUE | GREEN | PINK | PURPLE | RED | WHITE | YELLOW
  # default = BLUE

  # the style of the boss bar
  # pick one from: SEGMENTED_6 | SEGMENTED_10 | SEGMENTED_12 | SEGMENTED_20 | SOLID
  # default = SEGMENTED_6
  style: SEGMENTED_12
