You can drag&drop the "Selected Pack.txt" file in this directory into this webpage to download its associated textures:  https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs
That will recreate the resource pack used on SettleScape, apart from the following caveats:
- The hotbar from DarkUI and the NumberedHotbar hotbar are incompatible, so we had to manually splice them together.
- Several buttons in various UI files need to be manually modified to be blue when highlighted.  (BlueWidgetsHighlight is incomplete.)
- We use the larger plus from LargeAttackIndicator without using its larger sword.
